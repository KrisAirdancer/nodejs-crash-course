// Global Objects
    // Global objects are available to all parts of the application's code.
    // This file represents a global object.
    // All files have access to the built-in global variables and methods, several methods are automatically created for us to use.
        // You can see these by running node global in the terminal
        // You can also make your own global variables and functions.
    

// console.log(global);

// This is one of the provided global methods.
// This creates a 3 second wait, then prints "in the timeout".
// global.setTimeout( () => {
//     console.log('in the timeout');
//     clearInterval(int); // This line causes the setInterval method to be called during the timeout so that it stops running when the timeout does.
// }, 3000);

// // // This runs indefinitely unless you kill it in the console.
// const int = setInterval( () => {
//     console.log('in the interval');
// }, 1000);

// console.log(__dirname); // Gets the absoulte path of the directory that this file is in. It does not include the filename.
// console.log(__filename); // Gets the absoulte path of this file (filename included).
